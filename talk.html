		<h2> why custom mechanical keyboards? </h2>
    <p>
      Building custom mechanical keyboards is a fascinating, somewhat addictive, and rapidly growing hobby.
      Though sometimes expensive and time consuming, it's a worthwhile investment for many people:
      a custom mechanical keyboard can look, feel, and sound miles ahead of mass produced gaming and office keyboards.
      If we are constantly on computers and spend hours every day typing on keyboards, why would you not want the experience to be enjoyable?
    </p>

      </ul>
      <p> There are various parts to custom mechanical keyboards that people pay attention to, shown above.
      Though it may seem intimidating, we only have to focus on a few main parts, as others arent necessary for a complete keyboard (but are nice to have!) </p> <!-- my attempt at whitespace, kind of a mess both in code and presentation -->
        <h4> THE CASE </h4>
      <p> is the main "body" of the keyboard. It contains all of the parts, except for keycaps.
      <br> <br> They come in different sizes and materials. The case material can affect the sound of the keyboard when typing (think of the vibrations caused by hitting switches)
      It can also change looks as well. Some case materials are metals like brass or aluminium, transparent acrylic or polycarbonate, wood, and opaque plastic (the most common being alu and plastic)
      <br> <br> Case size determines the amount of keys on your final keyboard. Full sized keyboards are known as 100%, and have around 104 keys, with a numpad, fuction row, arrow and navigation keys, electronics
      Many people who are into custom keyboards prefer more compact form factors. The most common compact layouts include tenkeyless/tkl/80%, 75%, 65%, and 60%, which do away with the numpad, some/all navigation keys, and arrow keys, respectively.
      <br> <br> There are different ways in which components are mounted into the case, including tray, top, bottom, sandwich, integrated plate, plateless, and gasket mounting styles. </p>
      <br>
        <h4> THE PCB, </h4>
      <p> or printed curcuit board is analogous to the brain- the pcb registers keystrokes, and sends that information along a cable into the computer.
      It holds the switches, which can either be attached by soldering or hotswap sockets (special parts that allow you to use and take out swtiches without soldering, very convenient for beginners) </p>
      <br>
        <h4> PLATE </h4>
      <p> is placed above the pcb and is used to help hold the switches in place. Similarly to the case, it can be made of different materials (usually metals) that can affect acoustics and aesthetics </p>
      <br>
        <h4> STABILIZERS </h4>
      <p> are used to support the sides of longer keys, such as the spacebar, shift, backspace, and enter keys. They can be screwed into the pcb or mounted onto the plate </p>
      <br>
        <h4> SWITCHES </h4>
      <p> are what make mechanical keyboards mechanical. They are the most important factor in determining sound and feel.
      <br> <br> They're made up of a housing with a spring and interacting materials inside (that can make sounds when pressed), usually a cross shaped stem on the top to mount keycaps, and either 3 or 5 pins on the bottom to secure the swtich into the pcb.
      <br> <br> Mech swtiches are divided into three categories based on sound and feel - linear, tactile, and clicky.
      <br> <br> Linear switches are the most straightforward in terms of concept and feel. They don't have any resistance other than the spring in the housing, and make a sound through the impact of bottoming out (read: fully pressing) the swtich.
      Some linear swtiches include Cherry, Gateron, and Kailh reds, yellows, and blacks, and special, more expensive switches like Novelkeys Creams or Tealios.
      <br> <br> Tactile swtiches have a subtle bump in the middle of the key stroke. They're kind of hard to explain (the best way to experience the different switch types is to try them in person). Some tactile switches are NK Blueberry, Zealios, Cherry/Kailh/Gateron Brown. and Holy Pandas
      <br> <br> Clicky switches are the loudest and sharpest feeling switches. Theyre like tactiles on steroids, and made a super loud click sound (also caused by in-housing mechanisms) when pressed. Some clickly switches include Cherry/Kailh/Gateron Blue switches, and Kailh "box" switches. </p>
      <br>
        <h4> KEYCAPS </h4>
      <p> are placed on top of the swtiches, and are the part that you touch when you type. They can change the look and feel of the keyboard depending on color and material
      <br> <br> The most common materials are ABS and PBT plastic. Though each have different properties that some people may prefer over the other, the main factor of material quality is the thickness and quality of the plastic itself from the keycap manufacturer.
      <br> <br> The highest quality keycaps are manufactured by a single small company in Germany called GMK. Usually when you buy a set of high quality switches, they have the prefix GMK (eg, GMK Striker, Striker being the name of a keycap set).
      Other manufacturers include JTK, a similar quality Chinese manufacturer, and prefixes based on the shape of the keycaps aka its profile. Some profiles include MT3, SA, XDA, and DSA, which you can find at the beginning of keycap names. </p>
      <br>


    <h2> where do you buy them? </h2>
    <p>
      While you can buy available custom keyboard parts/DIY kits from Chinese websites like AliExpress, or Amazon, the highest quality parts are sold on specific small scale shops, through a selling and distribution method known as group buys.
      Because of the smaller scale of the hobby, Group Buys are limited time, small batch product cycles. When you order through a group buy along with hundreds or thousands of other people, the money directly goes to starting the manufacturing itself.
      Therefore, it can take months, sometimes more than a year, to receive your keyboard parts after you order them.
